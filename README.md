# Distance-Warning-Device

This device can be used to measure of people get to close to you. If a person (or an object) is shorter than 1,5 meters away from you the red LED lights up and an alarm signal can be heard from the speaker. You can change the distance to 6 feet in code, just change the distance value from 150 to 180. To use it, press the button, wait for 1 or 2 seconds and as long as you press the button the device works. Aim the two "eyes" to a person to check the distance.
